# Belly_Button


Our first step was to master the basics of Plotly.Furthermore, we identify the types of charts we were able to create with Plotly, we selected an appropriate visualization type for our dataset to visualize the types of bacteria that colonize their bellies for our volunteers? Some of them will be suitable for synthetic beef production, while others will not.


## Tools we saw in these challenge:

+ Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
+ D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
+ Parse data in JSON format.
+ Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
+ Use JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.
+ Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
+ How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.
+ Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.


Interactive dashboard and charts display bacteria that live inside the human body.
